# Wholesale Customer Segmentation and Analysis

## Description

This project performs unsupervised machine learning analysis on a wholesale customer dataset. The goal is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and gain insights into their preferences. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the required Python packages:

## Usage

- Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed (see Installation).
- Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform exploratory data analysis, clustering analysis, and PCA.
- Follow the comments and documentation within the code for detailed usage instructions.

## Data

- The dataset used in this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset, which contains information about customer annual spending on various product categories.
- You can find the dataset at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yourusername/datasetname).

## Analysis

- The project includes the following analyses:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Results

- The key findings from this project include:
### Customer Segmentation

- We successfully segmented the wholesale customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior. The key segments identified include:
  - Cluster 1: [Description of Cluster 1, e.g., "High-Spending Retailers"]
  - Cluster 2: [Description of Cluster 2, e.g., "Cafes and Restaurants"]
  - Cluster 3: [Description of Cluster 3, e.g., "Small Local Markets"]

- Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar preferences and spending patterns. These segments can be valuable for targeted marketing and product recommendations.

### Optimal Number of Clusters

- The Elbow Method and dendrogram analysis were used to determine the optimal number of clusters for our dataset. Based on these methods, we selected [number of clusters, e.g., "3 clusters"] as the appropriate number to represent the data effectively.

- The chosen number of clusters strikes a balance between granularity and interpretability, allowing us to capture meaningful customer segments.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- PCA revealed the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data by identifying the most important combinations of features (principal components).

- We found that the first [number of principal components, e.g., "2 principal components"] explained a significant percentage of the variance in the data. These components can be used to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information.

- The loadings analysis indicated that certain product categories have a strong influence on the principal components, shedding light on the relationships between different products.

- These results provide actionable insights for businesses, including opportunities for targeted marketing strategies, inventory optimization, and customer relationship management.
